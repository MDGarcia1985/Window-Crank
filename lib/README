# Window Crank Project - Libraries

This directory is intended for project-specific libraries for the Window Crank servo control system.

## Current Libraries

This project currently uses external libraries managed by PlatformIO:

- **U8g2** - OLED display library for SSD1306 128x64 displays
- **Arduino ESP32** - Core framework for ESP32 development

## Custom Libraries

Project-specific classes are located in the `src/` and `include/` directories:

- **servo** - ESP32 LEDC PWM servo control
- **display** - OLED display interface for system status
- **bleComm** - BLE communication for Flutter app integration

## Adding Libraries

To add project-specific libraries, create subdirectories here:

```
lib/
├── YourLibrary/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── YourLibrary.cpp
│   │   └── YourLibrary.h
│   └── library.json
└── README
```
